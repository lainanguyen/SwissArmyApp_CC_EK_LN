### Objective Summary:
The Swiss Army App is an application created for Highlander Industries as a means of helping the company's clients pass time while waiting for their appointments. This app is formatted for tablet use. The app's landing page sports the Highlander Industries logo and requests the user's name before proceeding to a page with buttons for selecting different activity options. The activities include a tip calculator, Mad Libs, baseball stats, Bible verses, and a love calculator. There is also a Settings page to change the user's nickname and to change five features across the app. The Swiss Army App strives to provide about 20 minutes of wholesome entertainment to clients to make their wait more enjoyable. 

### Installation & Usage:

### System Requirements:
As the app is made in JavaFX, it can be run on Windows, iOS, or Android devices. The app is formatted for a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 tablet; this tablet must have JDK 6 Update 13 installed at minimum.<br />
Installing IDEs such as Gluon VM and Mobile Project may be helpful.<br />
1GB of storage is necessary to run the application but 2GB is recommended.
